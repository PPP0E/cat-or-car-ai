## Introduction
Welcome to the most sophisticated, advanced, and "cutting-edge" AI you'll ever come across: The Cat-Car Classifier! Yes, you heard that right. This AI is designed to solve the age-old question that has troubled humanity for centuries: "Is this a cat or a car?" 

I bet you've often found yourself staring at a picture, completely baffled, unable to determine whether you're looking at a fluffy feline or a fast Ferrari. Well, fret no more, for we have the solution to all your cat-car conundrums!

## Installation
Setting up this extraordinary piece of technology is as easy as pie. Simply follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have `torch`, `torchvision`, and `PIL` installed. If not, just `pip install` them. You're smart. You can figure it out.
2. Download our [amazing AI code](/mnt/data/cat_car_classifier.py).
3. Save it somewhere safe, preferably not with your pictures of cats... or cars. 

## How to Use
Simply run the script and provide the path to your confusing image:
```bash
python cat_car_classifier.py path_to_your_image.jpg
```
Sit back, relax, and let the magic happen. In no time, our AI will tell you whether it's a cat, a car, or something else entirely (because let's face it, sometimes life isn't binary).

## Under the Hood
For those few nerds who care about the technical mumbo-jumbo:

Our model utilizes the unparalleled power of `resnet50` (because why not?). It processes your image, feeds it to the neural network, and classifies it based on the extremely comprehensive and exhaustive classes: cat, car, or neither.

## UI - Coming Soon (Maybe)
We've heard your cries for a user-friendly UI! And we've been working day and night (well, maybe just a couple of hours here and there) to make it a reality. But guess what? I got a build error and was too lazy to commit it. So, hang tight! Or don't. We're not really sure when or if it's coming.

## FAQs

**Q:** Why did you make this?
**A:** Because distinguishing between cats and cars is obviously the pinnacle of AI research.

**Q:** I fed it a picture of a dog, and it said "something else." Is this a bug?
**A:** No. It's a feature.

**Q:** Can I contribute?
**A:** Look around. Do you see a contributions section? Yeah, didn't think so.

## Acknowledgments
A massive shoutout to all the cats and cars out there for making this possible. Without you, this project would've been utterly pointless. Wait...
